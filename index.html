										<h2><a href="#">First Impression</a></h2>
										<p>Have you ever experienced that peculiar sensation of intense anxiety over a significant task or interview, only to have your torment abruptly dissolved by an unforeseen encounter? The weight of this task had consumed my every thought for an entire month; each hour at my desk, each restless second spent in my bed was haunted by the specter of my visa interview. The gravity of the situation seemed to draw every ounce of my being into its orbit, leaving me bereft of solace or reprieve.
	
											Yet, on the fateful day of the interview, an event occurred that defied all reason, a beautiful absurdity that forever altered my perception of reality. My chronic laziness, known to all who had the misfortune of interacting with me, led me to forget the crucial CNIC photocopy. As I scrambled in a frenzied haste to rectify my negligence, I found myself ensnared by the consequences of my own procrastination, spending a full thirty minutes in a state of anxious agitation to procure the missing document. Little did I know that those thirty minutes would yield a memory of unparalleled splendor.
											
											Upon my arrival at the embassy, a sight awaited me that defies the bounds of mere coincidence. There stood a girl, so uniquely captivating that my initial reaction was nothing short of awestruck: "Categorically Stunning" was the only phrase that seemed to encapsulate her essence. For the first time in my life, I felt an inexplicable crush on a human being, divorced from the realm of celebrity and adoration.
											
											Though I did not have the opportunity to study her visage in its entirety, the Universe seemed to conspire in its own enigmatic way. Our names were called simultaneously, and we both submitted our documents. The details of our brief encounter in the interview room elude me now, save for the fleeting memory of offering her my chair and the courteous gesture of informing her when her turn had come.
											
											The true magic unfurled itself after the interview, as I stood alongside an elderly couple, discussing the nuances of the visa process. My mind, starved of sleep and aching for the comfort of my bed, was wholly preoccupied with thoughts of rest. In this state of distracted yearning, she reappeared, accompanied by a friend, and inquired why the interview had not yet taken place. In those ten seconds, she etched an indelible image upon my memory.
											
											She was approximately five feet five inches tall, her figure perfectly proportioned to her height. Her eyes, dark and deep, held a silent eloquence that spoke to me without uttering a single word. I am convinced that no mortal could bear to gaze into those eyes for longer than ten seconds. Her lashes were dark and long, while her eyebrows remained in their natural state, untrimmed. Her forehead and face seemed to follow a divine symmetry, reminiscent of the Fibonacci sequence, and I have no doubt that her visage adhered to the Golden Ratio. Moles dotted her face like delicate flecks upon a canvas, drawing the observer's gaze in appreciation of her beauty. Her hair, a harmonious blend of black and brown, fell to an immediate length, enhancing her ethereal charm.
											
											In the brief exchange that followed, she inquired about my university and course, and we shared a few words. As the bus arrived, she took a seat behind mine. An internal conflict surged within me: I yearned to speak with her but was paralyzed by fear.
											
											That day, I found a perverse pride in my procrastination and laziness. For had I not been ensnared by my own shortcomings, I would never have had the fortune to encounter the most enchanting lady I have ever seen. In a twisted irony, my faults became the vessel through which I discovered an ineffable beauty, a serendipitous reminder that sometimes, even in our most flawed moments, we might be graced with the unexpected splendor of life.

										<h2><a href="#">The Best Day of my Life</a></h2>
										<p>Some days, life felt like a burden on existence, each second stretching into an eternity. Yet, on other days, time slipped by in the blink of an eye, filling us with hope and courage. July 26, 2024, was such a day. 

											Unplanned meetings hold a special charm, a warmth that lingers. In my wildest dreams, I never imagined meeting her, but it happened out of the blue. From 4:47 PM to 6:48 PM, those two hours with her were enough to sustain me through the hardest of days.
											
											As she opened the gate and looked at me, her gaze held a curious intensity, as if she was trying to piece together a memory that was just out of reach. It was a strange mix of recognition and forgetfulness. Seeing her again was beyond what I could have imagined—though I remembered her from before, she seemed like a stranger seen for the first time.I have never been intimidated by another person, but she was different. In an instant, I lost all sense of time and space, and for the first thirty minutes, I was oblivious to my surroundings. Her aura and presence were almost superhuman.
											Our exchange of greetings was marked by an unsettling disarray; her voice, rich and resonant, shattered my fragile poise. In my haste, I found myself bereft of direction, leading her aimlessly through our motions until we found ourselves bathed in the soft gloom of a shadow. There, with my nervousness somewhat subdued, I fixed my gaze upon her and inquired with uncharacteristic directness, “You remind me of my cousin sister. How many moles are there?” She responded with a soft, “Thirty-two.”
											
											Her hair, a beguiling melange of black and brown, framed her face with an artistry that seemed both deliberate and spontaneous. She wore black slippers and a white dress that lent her an ethereal grace. Evolutionary theory often posits that beauty and intelligence lie on opposite ends of a spectrum, rarely found in the same individual. Yet, she embodied both qualities perfectly. Her compliment about my attire was met with my preoccupation with my own feelings of gratitude. Walking beside her, my favorite lady, felt surreal—an experience I wanted to savor as though it were an eternal moment in the seven paradises.
											
											She was running late, but I asked her to join me for some shopping, and we grabbed a taxi to F-7. She seemed to notice every little thing I did, and for the first time, I was conscious of every move. In the cab, her presence made a strong impression. Her face was a blend of maturity and innocence, her forehead seemed to convey her whole being, and her hair was a beautiful mess.
											
											How could mere words encapsulate such a complex allure? Her beauty and innocence were beyond the reach of mere language, demanding the imagination of a poet to fully comprehend.
											
											Upon our arrival, a most peculiar blunder occurred—I, in a frantic rush, failed to open the gate for her. As we entered the mall, she confided that if any of her friends saw her with me, she would face an interrogation. I responded with a joke, attempting to deflect the awkwardness. Navigating the mall, I was plagued by confusion and nervousness. As we ascended to the first floor, I offered a man to her first, and she whispered, “Increase your numbers.” I was perplexed but led her to  outfitter..At the shopping mall, she seemed a bit uneasy and anxious. However, once she noticed my confusion and nervousness, her discomfort melted away. It was at that moment I realized she truly understood me. When she noted my hands as I selected a pant,  and remarked, “Please put in some effort yourself,” though my reluctance was palpableI felt her heart affirming a sense of trust in me. From then on, she trusted me and agreed to spend more time together.
											She guided my choices, and though shopping can be weary, I found myself entranced by her presence, losing track of the world around me. As we proceeded to the restaurant, she covered her face and questioned why Pakistani men are always so intent on seeking out women. I answered that I sought the universe itself, a playful wordplay that made her exclaim, “Toba Toba.”
											Despite my frequent visits to F-7, I found myself disoriented, a testament to my confusion. She suggested we sit somewhere rather than walk further.
											
											She observed my every move, perhaps to confirm what she already sensed about me. At my insistence, we arrived at a restaurant. At the restaurant, she sat opposite me, her demeanor revealing shyness as she rested her arm on the table, her gaze drifting westward. . I ordered pasta, mistakenly believing it might be her favorite, though I am not a big fan of fast food. She declined the pasta but drank only Sprite, sharing snippets of her life story. She sat with me, patiently listening to my nonsensical chatter for an hour. She showed interest in my stories, laughed at my jokes, and empathized with my experiences.
											
											Her eyes, imbued with an evocative expressiveness, seemed to communicate unspoken truths. She was shy, unable to meet my gaze directly, yet she listened intently. Those eyes were revealing, perhaps too revealing, and maybe that was why she avoided direct eye contact.Her smiles and ease of conversation were captivating I was deeply impressed by her eloquence, her poise, her dress sense, and her gestures.Her demeanor at the restaurant spoke of self-respect, confidence, and self-love. Her style was simple; I still remember the faint touch of pink makeup on her nose, a detail she seemed unconcerned with. She didn’t do anything a girl of her age might do to look more attractive or beautiful because she was comfortable with her own self-image and sought no validation from others.
											Afterward, I booked a ride for her, a gesture she marked with a critique—an oversight that left me with lingering regret.While booking the ride, a lady came up and suggested that I buy some *gajray* for her. I wanted to, but she blushed. I asked her about her weight and complimented her by saying she looked like a supermodel. Once again, she blushed.Yet, despite my hyper-perfectionism and the numerous imperfections in my treatment of her, she expressed appreciation for the time spent together. In the clarity of our interactions, I realized the profundity of simply being with someone I deeply admired.
											I had long considered myself a misfit, a soul adrift in melancholy and self-doubt. But this woman showed me the essence of living, caring, breathing, and reveling in the present. Our moments together were a balm to my troubled spirit, offering a glimpse into a happiness I had scarcely believed possible. Her presence alone was enough to kindle hope in my heart. Though her life is fraught with difficulties, I wish only for her joy and have faith in her resilience. To have met her, to have shared such moments, is a blessing I treasure deeply.

										<h2><a href="#">The Red Dress <br />
										and the color of her photograph</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/sidney-pearce-yPMJliKzyc4-unsplash.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>             The color of her Photograph

										On a summer afternoon, when the air was thick with heat and the light was languid, she sent me a photograph. It was of her in a red dress, a color so vivid and exact that it seemed to pulse with its own rhythm. The dress looked almost as though it was made for her—an effortless fit that spoke volumes without saying a word. It arrived like a small, precious gift, a moment of clarity amid the usual disarray.
										
										The night before had been marked by a lingering tension between us. I had hurt her, and the distress of it had kept me awake, turning over my mistakes in my mind. Yet, despite this, she extended an olive branch through the photograph.It  was an act of reconciliation, a gesture that sought to bridge the gap between us.
										
										Her hair was swept up by the wind, or maybe it was her presence that made the wind move. She was standing on a roof, surrounded by the quiet greenery of the cityscape. Her black slippers contrasted sharply against the lush, almost pastoral scene, like a note of levity in an otherwise serene setting. She stood there with a kind of simplicity that was both captivating and disarming.
										
										She looked out from the photograph with an expression that was both vulnerable and assured. The hair that framed her face was a deep black in the middle, fading to brown at the edges—a subtle shift in tone that seemed deliberate, almost as if she had taken care in how she presented herself. In her gaze, there was a kind of quiet intensity that felt almost like it was reaching out to me, as if she were communicating something deeply personal through the lens of the camera.
										
										A small mole on her cheek was the only real imperfection in an otherwise perfect image, and yet it seemed to lend her an air of authenticity, a reminder that even the most carefully composed moments are touched by the real and the human. She wore the red dress with a kind of effortless grace that made me question whether the color enhanced her beauty or if it was simply a reflection of her own inherent elegance.
										
										In the background, a bird flew by, almost like an afterthought in the composition of the photograph, but somehow it felt significant. It was as though it was there to witness and perhaps even convey the message of her presence to the world beyond. It made me wonder about how to encapsulate such an image in words—whether it was even possible to convey the full essence of what I saw and felt.
										
										She has this way of breaking me down and then piecing me back together, a dynamic that has become familiar in our interactions. She stirs a curiosity in me, an appetite for understanding that I can’t quite satisfy. Her presence fills my life with a kind of quiet delight, making me feel both grounded and introspective.
										
										Her smile and eyes hold a kind of gravity that makes it easy to lose oneself in them. I find myself reflecting on the way she seems to see through to my core, and it makes me question whether I’m merely lucky or if there is something more significant at play. Her presence strikes me as a rare and profound thing, something that seems both ordinary and extraordinary in its impact.
										
										In her gaze, there’s a certain kind of clarity, a sense of seeing something pure and essential. It makes me wonder about the nature of our connection—whether it’s a dream or a reality that I’m fortunate to experience. She represents a kind of light and hope that feels both grounded and transcendent, a reason to keep striving and to find meaning in the everyday.

										To my favorite lady in the world <br />
									   
									  Sitting in my room, lost in my head,<br />
									  Thinking about how it all came and went.<br />
									  You sent a photograph, a smile, and then,<br />
									  You sent me sweet anger, I couldn't comprehend.<br />
									  
									  Days have passed, the clocks have stopped,<br />
									  You fill the seconds with your essence and soul.<br />
									  Years of agony fade with your care,<br />
									  Like my suffering found its end right there.<br />
									  
									  You said, "I don't love you, let me go,<br />
									  Don't hold on, you need to forget."<br />
									  You said, "I'm not the only one, there are plenty around,<br />
									  Go find another, I'm a hard place to be found."<br />
									  
									  You taught me humility, the art of letting go,<br />
									  You made me lose myself in love, now I know.<br />
									  You were a Sunday, so brief yet so long,<br />
									  A sunny day in February's endless cold.<br />
									  
									  You were the cool breeze on a hot June day,<br />
									  An unfinished story, a Kafka play.<br />
									  You came like the big bang, made my life bloom,<br />
									  Filled my lungs with life, made my soul swoon.<br />
									  
									  My ego's shattered, my mind's at peace,<br />
									  Is it love I seek or a way to feel complete?<br />
									  Is letting go more important than holding on?<br />
									  Is it your happiness or my desire that's strong?<br />
									  
									  In the end, I know what to do,<br />
									  I'll let you go, keep my promise to you.<br />
									  I'd choose you in a million lifetimes,<br />
									  But now, I'll do what you need this time.<br />
									  
									  With just twelve days left, I'm happy and content,<br />
									  Having you was more than worth the time spent.<br />
									  Your leaving doesn't break me, it sets me free,<br />
									  My love is whole, and that's enough for me.<br />
									  
									  No ego left to mourn like a loser,<br />
									  I'll be happy knowing I'm in your thoughts, dear.<br />
									  You're a white rose, a rare diamond,<br />
									  The reason I believe, the reason I find faith.<br />
									  
									  You taught me to pray, showed me the divine,<br />
